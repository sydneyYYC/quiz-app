I used a for loop to loop through each question, and moving to the next question by increasing "currentQuestion" by one.

Im having problems finishing the game at the right time. I cant make the finishgame() function run at the last question because it will finish the game too early. I cant change it to 4 because there is not another question to change to. 

I can :

Add a 4th question that never gets shown b/c it will be changed into a "hidden" class before the player can read it

I can see if i can load a final page that just displays score instead of the questions , maybe on a toggle?

I dont want to change the data i am given too much, it seems hacky . 

Note: need to add a "wrong" indicator

Now that medieval period is finished I want to move on to other periods, and a landing page.
